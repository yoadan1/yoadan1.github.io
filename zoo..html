    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>
    <em>Lions eat about 18 pounds of meat per day. That would be like a human eating more than 70 hamburgers. The lion is the only member of the cat family that has a tasseled tail. The tassel doesn’t just look good, it also relays messages such as “come this way.” A tassel first appears when a lion is 5–7 months old.</em>

    The tiger (Panthera tigris) is a member of the genus Panthera and the largest living cat species native to Asia. It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.
    Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates, which it takes by ambush. It lives a mostly solitary life and occupies home ranges, defending these from individuals of the same sex. The range of a male tiger overlaps with that of multiple females with whom he mates. Females give birth to usually two or three cubs that stay with their mother for about two years. When becoming independent, they leave their mother's home range and establish their own.
    Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and are locally extinct in West and Central Asia, in large areas of China and on the islands of Java and Bali. Today, the tiger's range is severely fragmented. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, as its range is thought to have declined by 53% to 68% since the late 1990s. Major threats to tigers are habitat destruction and fragmentation due to deforestation, poaching for fur and the illegal trade of body parts for medicinal purposes.
    Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict as they attack and prey on livestock in areas where natural prey is scarce.

<h4>wolf</h4>

<p> The wolf (Canis lupus;[b] pl.: wolves), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf,
    is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus 
    have been recognized, including the dog and dingo, though gray wolves, as popularly understood,
    only comprise naturally-occurring wild subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the
    family Canidae, and is further distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears
    and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related 
    closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce 
    fertile hybrids with them. The wolf's fur is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black,
    although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.
    Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as 
    demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour, 
    including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring.
     Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity
    and in response to competitionfor food within the pack. Wolves are also
    territorial, and fights over territory are among the principal causes of mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion,
    and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. 
    Pathogens and parasites, notably the rabies virus, may infect wolves.</p>
<em>Wolves use dens for the rearing of their young. ...
     Activity is diurnal. ...
     Wolves hunt in packs. ...
     Packs are usually composed of a mated pair that are the most dominant animals in the group,
     and their offspring of one or more years. ...
    Gray wolves communicate using vocalizations, scent marking, and body language.
